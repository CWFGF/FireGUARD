Fire survival is determined for each point at each time step. Survival is dependent on F\+F\+MC, D\+MC, and fuel in the cell. If the fire is determined to have not survived in both the F\+F\+MC and D\+MC fuels then it is considered extinguished and all points in that cell are removed from the simulation. Since the cell is already marked as burned at this point, it will not burn again.

Probability of survival is determined as per the papers referenced, with the F\+BP fuel types having been assigned an F\+F\+MC duff type and a D\+MC duff type, and the moisture for each type being calculated based off the current indices.\hypertarget{survival_References}{}\doxysection{References}\label{survival_References}
