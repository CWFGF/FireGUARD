Probability throughout the simulations is handled using pre-\/rolled random numbers based on a fixed seed, so that simulation results are reproducible.

Probability is stored as \textquotesingle{}thresholds\textquotesingle{} for a certain event on a day-\/by-\/day and hour-\/by-\/hour basis. If the calculated probability of that type of event matches or exceeds the threshold then the event will occur.

Each iteration of a scenario will have its own thresholds, and thus different behaviour can occur with the same input indices.

Thresholds are used to determine\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item extinction
\item spread events 
\end{DoxyItemize}
