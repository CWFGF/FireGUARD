Hourly weather is read from input and used as-\/is with no validation.

Generally, indices are constant for all cells for the day in each simulation. The exceptions to this are \mbox{\hyperlink{classtbd_1_1wx_1_1Wind}{Wind}} and F\+F\+MC, and by extension, I\+SI and F\+WI.

Hourly wind is calculated based on a simple statistical analysis, with wind for each hour being a proportion of the daily wind.

F\+F\+MC is calculated using the method described in \href{https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/Frr/FRR245.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+for.\+gov.\+bc.\+ca/hfd/pubs/\+Docs/\+Frr/\+F\+R\+R245.\+pdf}}
